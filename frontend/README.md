# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### How to access via phone from WSL
---------------
#### Configure Firewall Settings
- Go to Firewall & network protection -> Advanced settings
- On the left pane, click Inbound Rules
- On the actions pane on the right, click 'New Rule...'
- When asked 'What type of rule would you like to create?', choose 'Port', then click on 'Next >'.
- For Protocols and Ports, choose 'TCP'. Then input `3000` in Specific local ports. Then click on 'Next >'.
- Select 'Allow the connection' and 'Next >'
- Leave the default checks on Domain, Private, and Public options. 'Next >'
- Set a name for the rule, e.g. 'Allow port Node.js on Port 3000'
#### Port Forwarding to WSL from PowerShell
- Open PowerShell as administrator
- Look for your local machine's IP address via entering the command `ipconfig`
- Enter the command `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=YOUR-IP-ADDRESS-HERE connectport=3000 connectaddress=$($(wsl hostname -I).Trim());`. Don't forget to input your own IP address at the `listenaddress`.
#### You can now try to access the website in a mobile device via the local machine's IP address and the port. Ensure that you are on the same network for it to work.
